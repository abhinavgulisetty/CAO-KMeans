# K-Means Clustering (Parallel and Sequential)

This repository contains two implementations of the **K-Means** clustering algorithm:

1. **Parallel K-Means**: A parallelized version using OpenMP to speed up the assignment of data points to clusters.
2. **Sequential K-Means**: A sequential version of the K-Means algorithm with no parallelization, designed for comparison purposes.

Additionally, there is a **Python script** that generates a random dataset for testing and running both the parallel and sequential K-Means implementations.

## Overview

### Parallel K-Means
The parallelized version of the K-Means algorithm uses OpenMP to parallelize the assignment step, where each data point is assigned to its closest centroid. This improves the performance on multi-core processors.

### Sequential K-Means
The sequential version of the K-Means algorithm is implemented without any parallelization. This serves as a baseline for testing and comparison against the parallel version.

### Python Dataset Generator
A Python script is included to generate a random dataset of points with a specified number of dimensions. The generated dataset can be used with both the sequential and parallel K-Means implementations.

## Requirements

### For K-Means C Code
To compile and run the C code, you need the following:
- **GCC** or any compatible C compiler
- **OpenMP** (for parallel execution in the parallel K-Means version)

### For Python Script
- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy** (for generating the dataset)

### Dependencies:
- **gcc**: C Compiler (or similar)
- **libomp-dev**: For OpenMP support (for parallel K-Means)
- **python3**: Python version 3 or higher
- **numpy**: For dataset generation

You can install the Python dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy
```
This will generate a dataset with 5000 points and 5 dimensions by default. You can change the number of points and dimensions by modifying the parameters in the script.

## Running Sequential K-Means

To compile and run the sequential K-Means implementation:

1. **Compile the C code**:

    ```bash
    gcc -o kmeans_sequential kmeans_sequential.c -lm
    ```

2. **Run the program**:

    ```bash
    ./kmeans_sequential
    ```

   This will read the dataset from `data.txt`, perform K-Means clustering (sequentially), and output the results including the number of iterations and execution time.

## Running Parallel K-Means

To compile and run the parallel K-Means implementation:

1. **Compile the C code** (ensure OpenMP is supported):

    ```bash
    gcc -o kmeans_parallel kmeans_parallel.c -lm -fopenmp
    ```

2. **Run the program**:

    ```bash
    ./kmeans_parallel
    ```

   This will read the dataset from `data.txt`, perform K-Means clustering using parallel execution, and output the results including the number of iterations and execution time.

## Example Output

For both the sequential and parallel implementations, the output will include:

K-means completed in X iterations 
Sequential/Parallel execution time: Y seconds


Where:
- `X` is the number of iterations the algorithm took to converge.
- `Y` is the time it took to run the algorithm.

### File Descriptions:
- **`kmeans_parallel.c`**: C implementation of K-Means with parallelization using OpenMP.
- **`kmeans_sequential.c`**: C implementation of K-Means without parallelization.
- **`generate_dataset.py`**: Python script that generates a synthetic dataset for use with the K-Means algorithms.
- **`data.txt`**: A sample dataset generated by `generate_dataset.py`. This file contains random data points in a format suitable for the K-Means algorithms.
- **`Makefile`** (optional): A Makefile to simplify the compilation process (if you prefer using Make).
- **`README.md`**: This documentation file.

## Additional Notes:
- You can customize the number of data points and the number of dimensions by modifying the parameters in the `generate_dataset.py` script.
- Ensure that your C compiler supports OpenMP if you're compiling the parallel version.
- The `kmeans_parallel.c` file is parallelized to run on multi-core processors, significantly speeding up the process for large datasets.
